Dynamic Programming in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of dynamic programming algorithms for solving various problems.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem just once, storing the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computations. This approach is especially useful for problems where the solution to a subproblem depends on the solution to other subproblems, as it allows for efficient computation of the overall solution.

The dynamic programming algorithms implemented in this repository include:

Fibonacci sequence: finding the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming, with both memoization and tabulation approaches.

Longest common subsequence: finding the longest common subsequence between two strings using dynamic programming.

Knapsack problem: solving the classic knapsack problem using dynamic programming, with both 0/1 and unbounded variations.

Coin change problem: finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a given sum using dynamic programming.

All implementations are written in Python and include detailed explanations of the algorithm used, along with examples demonstrating their use.

Feel free to use these implementations as a starting point for your own projects, or to contribute to the repository with your own dynamic programming implementations. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
