This is a solution to the "Clone Graph" problem, which is a popular graph traversal problem in computer science.

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, create a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a value (val) and a list of its neighbors (neighbors).

The provided solution uses a breadth-first search algorithm to traverse the input graph and create a deep copy of each node. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the original nodes and their corresponding clones.

The algorithm starts by creating a clone of the input node and enqueuing it in a queue for further processing. It then uses a while loop to process all nodes in the queue. For each node in the queue, it creates clones of its neighbors and adds them to the neighbor list of the corresponding clone node.

The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the input graph. The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n), as it uses a dictionary to store the original nodes and their corresponding clones.

To use the solution, create a new instance of the Solution class and call the cloneGraph method with the input node as a parameter. The method returns a deep copy of the input graph.

The "Clone Graph" problem is a fundamental problem in graph traversal, and the provided solution is a simple and efficient way to create a deep copy of an input graph. With the usage instructions provided, you should be able to easily clone any connected undirected graph.
