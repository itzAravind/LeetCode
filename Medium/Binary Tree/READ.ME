Each problem has a dedicated folder named ProblemX, where X represents the problem number. Inside each problem folder, there is a Python file Solution.py that contains the implementation of the solution to that problem. Additionally, there is a README.md file that explains the problem statement, approach used to solve the problem, and provides a brief analysis of the time and space complexity of the solution.
