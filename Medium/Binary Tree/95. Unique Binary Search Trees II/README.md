Solution Explanation
This is a recursive solution that uses memoization to improve its performance. The function dfs takes two parameters left and right, which represent the range of values from left to right (inclusive) that can be used as roots of the BST.

At each recursive call, we iterate over all the possible roots from left to right. For each root, we recursively generate all the possible left subtrees and right subtrees. We then combine each left subtree with each right subtree to form a valid BST with the current root.

The base case of the recursion is when left is greater than right. In this case, we return a list with a single None value, which represents an empty subtree. If left is equal to right, we return a list with a single node that contains the value left.

The @lru_cache decorator is used to memoize the results of the function. This improves the performance of the function by storing the previously computed results and avoiding recomputation of the same results.

The final call to the function dfs(1, n) generates all possible BSTs that can be formed using the values from 1 to n (inclusive) as nodes.

Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * Catalan(n)), where Catalan(n) is the nth Catalan number. The reason for this time complexity is that for each root, we need to generate all possible combinations of left and right subtrees, which takes Catalan(n) time. We need to do this for each value of the root from 1 to n, which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2 * Catalan(n)).

The space complexity of this solution is also O(n^2 * Catalan(n)), as we need to store all the generated trees in a list. The memoization using @lru_cache also requires additional space to store the previously computed results.
