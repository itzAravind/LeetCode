Algorithm Explanation
The trap function takes a list of heights height and returns the amount of water that can be trapped between the pillars. The algorithm first checks if the list has less than or equal to two elements, then no water can be trapped, and the function returns zero. For a list with three or more elements, two pointers left and right are set to point to the second and second last elements, respectively, and two variables maxLeft and maxRight are set to the height of the leftmost and rightmost elements, respectively.

Then, the algorithm iterates until left is greater than right. If maxLeft is less than maxRight, it means that the rightmost pillar is higher than the leftmost pillar. Hence, the algorithm checks if the height of the pillar at the current left index is greater than maxLeft. If so, the height of the leftmost pillar is updated to that value; otherwise, the difference between the maxLeft height and the current height is added to the answer variable ans. In contrast, if maxRight is less than maxLeft, the algorithm updates maxRight to the height of the current pillar at index right if it is greater than maxRight. Otherwise, the difference between maxRight and the current height is added to ans.

After the loop completes, the function returns ans, which holds the amount of trapped water between the pillars.

Complexity Analysis
The algorithm iterates through the list once, so the time complexity of the function is O(n). The algorithm uses only constant space for the variables, so the space complexity is O(1).

Benchmark
The given code has a runtime of 48 ms, which is faster than 92.74% of other solutions submitted for the same problem
